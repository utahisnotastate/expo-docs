## `Expo.LinearGradient`

### props

 `colors`  
An array of colors that represent stops in the gradient. At least two colors are required (otherwise it's not a gradient, it's just a fill!).

 `start`  
An array of `[x, y]` where x and y are floats. They represent the position that the gradient starts at, as a fraction of the overall size of the gradient. For example, `[0.1, 0.1]` means that the gradient will start 10% from the top and 10% from the left.

 `end`  
Same as start but for the end of the gradient.

 `locations`  
An array of the same lenth as `colors`, where each element is a float with the same meaning as the `start` and `end` values, but instead they indicate where the color at that index should be.

title: SQLite
---

This module gives access to a database that can be queried through a [WebSQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/)-like API. The database is persisted across restarts of your app.

An [example to do list app](https://github.com/expo/sqlite-example) is available that uses this module for storage.

### `Expo.SQLite.openDatabase(name, version, description, size)`

Open a database, creating it if it doesn't exist, and return a `Database` object.

#### Arguments

-   **name (_string_)** -- Name of the database file to open.

  The `version`, `description` and `size` arguments are ignored, but are accepted by the function for compatibility with the WebSQL specification.

#### Returns

Returns a `Databse` object, described below.

### `Database` objects

`Database` objects are returned by calls to `Expo.SQLite.openDatabase()`. Such an object represents a connection to a database on your device. They support one method:

-   `db.transaction(callback, error, success)`

    Execute a database transaction.

    #### Parameters

    -   **callback (_function_)** -- A function representing the transaction to perform. Takes a `Transaction` (see below) as its only parameter, on which it can add SQL statements to execute.
    -   **error (_function_)** -- Called if an error occured processing this transaction. Takes a single parameter describing the error.
    -   **success (_function_)** -- Called when the transaction has completed executing on the database.

### `Transaction` objects

A `Transaction` object is passed in as a parameter to the `callback` parameter for the `db.transaction()` method on a `Database` (see above). It allows enqueuing SQL statements to perform in a database transaction. It supports one method:

-   `tx.executeSql(sqlStatement, arguments, success, error)`

    Enqueue a SQL statement to execute in the transaction. Authors are strongly recommended to make use of the `?` placeholder feature of the method to avoid against SQL injection attacks, and to never construct SQL statements on the fly.

    #### Parameters

    -   **sqlStatement (_string_)** -- A string containing a database query to execute expressed as SQL. The string may contain `?` placeholders, with values to be substituted listed in the `arguments` parameter.
    -   **arguments (_array_)** -- An array of values (numbers or strings) to substitute for `?` placeholders in the SQL statement.
    -   **success (_function_)** -- Called when the query is successfuly completed during the transaction. Takes two parameters: the transaction itself, and a `ResultSet` object (see below) with the results of the query.
    -   **error (_function_)** -- Called if an error occured executing this particular query in the transaction. Takes two parameters: the transaction itself, and the error object.

### `ResultSet` objects

`ResultSet` objects are returned through second parameter of the `success` callback for the `tx.executeSql()` method on a `Transaction` (see above). They have the following form:

```
{
  insertId,
  rowsAffected,
  rows: {
    length,
    item(),
    _array,
  },
}
```

-   **insertId (_number_)** -- The row ID of the row that the SQL statement inserted into the database, if a row was inserted.

-   **rowsAffected (_number_)** -- The number of rows that were changed by the SQL statement.

-   **rows.length (_number_)** -- The number of rows returned by the query.

-   **rows.item (_function_)** -- `rows.item(index)` returns the row with the given `index`. If there is no such row, returns `null`.

-   **rows._array (_number_)** -- The actual array of rows returned by the query. Can be used directly instead of getting rows through `rows.item()`.

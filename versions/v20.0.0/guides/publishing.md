title: Publishing
---

While you’re developing your project, you’re writing code on your
computer, and when you use XDE or exp, a server and the React Native
packager run on your machine and bundle up all your source code and make
it available from a URL. Your URL for a project you’re working on
probably looks something like this:
`exp://i3-kvb.ccheever.an-example.exp.direct:80`

`exp.direct` is a domain we use for tunneling, so that even if you’re
behind a VPN or firewall, any device on the internet that has your URL
should be able to access your project. This makes it much easier to open
your project on your phone or send it someone else you’re collaborating
with who isn’t on the same LAN.

But since the packager and server are running on your computer, if you
turn off your laptop or close XDE, you won’t be able to load your
project from that URL. "Publish" is the term we use for deploying your
project. It makes your project available at a persistent URL, for
example https://expo.io/@community/native-component-list, which can be
opened with the Expo client. It also uploads all of your app images,
fonts, and videos to a CDN ([read more
here](how-expo-works.html#publishingdeploying-an-expo-app-in-production)).

## How to Publish

To publish a project, click the Publish button in XDE. (It’s in the
upper right of the window.) If you're using the exp cli tool, then run
`exp publish`. No setup is required, go ahead and create a new project
and publish it without any changes and you will see that it works.

When you do this, the packager will minify all your code and generate
two versions of your code (one for iOS, one for Android) and then upload
those to a CDN. You’ll get a link like [https://exp.host/@ccheever/an-example](https://exp.host/@ccheever/an-example)
that anyone can load your project from.

Any time you want to deploy an update, hit publish again and a new
version will be available immediately to your users the next time they
open it.

## Deploying to the App Store and Play Store

When you're ready to distribute your app to end-users, you can create a
standalone app binary (an ipa or apk file) and put it in the iOS App
Store and the Google Play Store. [See the full guide to building a
standalone app.](building-standalone-apps.html)

When you build the binary, the current version of your app JavaScript is
bundled so that it loads immediately the first time the app opens. But
you're not stuck with that version of your code, you can publish updates
at any time after that without needing to re-build the binary. For
example, if you find a bug or want to add some functionality to the app
after submitting the binary.

The standalone app knows to look for updates at your app's published
url, and if you publish an update then the next time a user opens your
app they will automatically download the new version. These are
commonly referred to as "Over the Air" (OTA) updates, the functionality
is similar to [CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/), but it
is built into Expo so you don't need to install anything.

Updates are handled differently on iOS and Android. On Android, updates
are downloaded in the background. This means that the first time a user opens
your app after an update they will get the old version while the new version
is downloaded in the background. The second time they open the app they'll get
the new version. On iOS, updates are downloaded synchronously, so users will
get the new version the first time they open your app after an update.

## Limitations

If you make any of the following changes in `app.json`, you will need to
re-build the binaries for your app for the change to take effect:

- Increment the Expo SDK Version
- Change anything under the `ios` or `android` keys
- Change your app `icon`
- Change your app `name`
- Change your app `scheme`
- Change your `facebookScheme`

## Privacy

You can set the privacy of your project in your `app.json` configuration
file by setting the key “privacy” to either `“public”` or `“unlisted”`.

These options work similarly to the way they do on YouTube. Unlisted
project URLs will be secret unless you tell people about them or share
them. Public projects might be surfaced to other developers.

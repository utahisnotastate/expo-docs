---

Expo includes support for payments through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/) on iOS via ExpoKit, and Stripe and Android Pay on Android.

Need more help than what's on the page? The Payments module is largely based off [tipsi-stripe](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-stripe). The documentation and questions there may prove helpful.

## Setup

If you haven't done payments with Stripe before, create an account with [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register). After getting the account set up, navigate to the [Stripe API dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys). Here, you'll need to make a note of the Publishable key and Secret key listed.

## Adding the Payments Module on iOS

The Payments module is currently only supported through ExpoKit on iOS (to understand why, refer to [Why ExpoKit on iOS?](#why-expokit-on-ios?)).

First, detach your Expo project using ExpoKit (refer to [Detach to ExpoKit]('../guides/detach.md') for more information). Then, navigate to and open `your-project-name/ios/Podfile`. Add "Payments" to your Podfile's subspecs. Example:

```ruby

...
target 'your-project-name' do
  pod 'ExpoKit',
    :git => "https://github.com/expo/expo.git",
    :subspecs => [
      "Core",
      "CPP", # Add a comma here!
      "Payments" # Add this line here!
    ]

  pod 'React',
  ...

```

Finally, make sure [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is installed and run `pod install` in `your-project-name/ios`. This will add the Payments module files to your project and the corresponding dependencies.

## Adding the Payments Module on Android

The Payments module is included with the Expo bundle on Android. Skip ahead to [importing payments](#importing-payments).

## Importing Payments

The Payments SDK is in Alpha and currently lives under Expo's **DangerZone** namespace. You can import it like this:

```javascript
import { DangerZone } from 'expo';
const { Payments } = DangerZone;
```

## Using the Payments SDK

First, initialize the Payments module with your credentials:

```javascript
payments.initialize({
  publishableKey: 'PUBLISHABLE_KEY' // Your Stripe publishable key
})
```

Next, you'll need to create a token object. After creating the token, you'll need to send it to some kind of backend (for example, a [Node.js server](https://stripe.com/docs/api/node)) to handle processing the payment. It's important not to handle sensitive card details in the front-end Expo application.

### The Token object

A token object returned from submitting payment details (via `paymentRequestWithApplePayAsync` and `createTokenWithCardAsync`) to the Stripe API.

##### `token`

An object with the following keys:

* `tokenId` _String_ - The value of the token. You can store this value on your server and use it to make charges and customers.
* `created` _Number_ - When the token was created.
* `livemode` _Number_ - Whether or not this token was created in livemode. Will be `1` if you used your `Live Publishable Key`, and `0` if you used your `Test Publishable Key`.
* `card` _Object_ - The credit card details object that were used to create the token.
* `bankAccount` _Object_ - The external (bank) account details object that were used to create the token.
* `extra` _Object_  (iOS only)- An additional information that method can provide.

##### `card`

An object with the following keys:

* `cardId` _String_ - The Stripe ID for the card.
* `brand` _String_ - The card’s brand. Can be one of: `JCB`|`American Express`|`Visa`|`Discover`|`Diners Club`|`MasterCard`|`Unknown`.
* `funding` _String_ (iOS only) - The card’s funding. Can be one of: `debit`|`credit`|`prepaid`|`unknown`.
* `last4` _String_ - The last 4 digits of the card.
* `dynamicLast4` _String_ (iOS only) - For cards made with `Apple Pay`, this refers to the last 4 digits of the `Device Account Number` for the tokenized card.
* `isApplePayCard` _Bool_ (iOS only) - Whether or not the card originated from Apple Pay.
* `expMonth` _Number_ - The card’s expiration month. 1-indexed (i.e. 1 == January)
* `expYear` _Number_ - The card’s expiration year.
* `country` _String_ - Two-letter ISO code representing the issuing country of the card.
* `currency` _String_ - This is only applicable when tokenizing debit cards to issue payouts to managed accounts. The card can then be used as a transfer destination for funds in this currency.
* `name` _String_ - The cardholder’s name.
* `addressLine1` _String_ - The cardholder’s first address line.
* `addressLine2` _String_ - The cardholder’s second address line.
* `addressCity` _String_ - The cardholder’s city.
* `addressState` _String_ - The cardholder’s state.
* `addressCountry` _String_ - The cardholder’s country.
* `addressZip` _String_ - The cardholder’s zip code.

### Generating a token with Apple Pay

Remember: to use Apple Pay on a real device, you need to [set up apple pay first](#enabling-apple-pay-in-expokit).

### `openApplePaySetup()`

Opens the user interface to set up credit cards for Apple Pay.

### `deviceSupportsApplePayAsync() -> Promise`

Returns whether the user can make Apple Pay payments.
User may not be able to make payments for a variety of reasons. For example, this functionality may not be supported by their hardware, or it may be restricted by parental controls.
Returns `true` if the device supports making payments; otherwise, `false`.

_NOTE_: iOS Simulator always returns `true`

### `paymentRequestWithApplePayAsync(items, [options]) -> Promise`

Launch the `Apple Pay` view to accept payment.

#### `items`

An array of object with the following keys:

* `label` _String_ - A short, localized description of the item.
* `amount` _String_ - The summary item’s amount.

_NOTE_: The final item should represent your company; it'll be prepended with the word "Pay" (i.e. "Pay Tipsi, Inc $50")

#### `options`

An object with the following keys:

* `requiredBillingAddressFields` _String_ - A bit field of billing address fields that you need in order to process the transaction. Can be one of: `all`|`name`|`email`|`phone`|`postal_address` or not specify to disable.
* `requiredShippingAddressFields` _String_ - A bit field of shipping address fields that you need in order to process the transaction. Can be one of: `all`|`name`|`email`|`phone`|`postal_address` or not specify to disable.
* `shippingMethods` _Array_ - An array of `shippingMethod` objects that describe the supported shipping methods.
* `currencyCode` _String_ - The three-letter ISO 4217 currency code.

#### `shippingMethod`

An object with the following keys:

### `completeApplePayRequestAsync()/cancelApplePayRequestAsync() -> Promise`

After `requiredBillingAddressFields` you should complete the operation by calling `completeApplePayRequest` or cancel if an error occurred. This closes Apple Pay. (resolves to undefined, you do not need to store the Promise)

#### Extra info

Token's `extra` field

#### `extra`

An object with the following keys:

* `shippingMethod` _Object_ - Selected `shippingMethod` object.
* `billingContact` _Object_ - The user's billing `contact` object.

}]

const shippingMethods = [{
  id: 'fedex',
  label: 'FedEX',
  detail: 'Test @ 10',
  amount: '10.00',
}]

const options = {
  requiredBillingAddressFields: 'all',
  requiredShippingAddressFields: 'all',
  shippingMethods,
}

const token = await payments.paymentRequestWithApplePayAsync(items, options)

// Client specific code
// api.sendTokenToBackend(token)

// You should complete the operation by calling
payments.completeApplePayRequestAsync()

// Or cancel if an error occurred
// payments.cancelApplePayRequestAsync()
```

### Generating a token by launching a card form

### `paymentRequestWithCardFormAsync(options) -> Promise`

#### Example

```js
const params = {
  // mandatory
  number: '4242424242424242',
  expMonth: 11,
  expYear: 17,

## Enabling Apple Pay in ExpoKit

If you want to use Apple Pay for payments, you'll need to set up your merchant ID in XCode first. Note that you do not need to go through this process to use the Payments module - you can still process payments with Stripe without going through the steps in this section.

If you haven't already, set up an Apple Merchant ID via the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/). Then, open the application in XCode and navigate to the capabilities tab. Enable Apple Pay and insert your merchant ID into the corresponding space.

![applepay](https://imgur.com/QcuhCn4)

Finally, you'll want to include your merchant ID in the JavaScript code before publishing your standalone application. Change the initialization of payments to mimic the following:

```javascript
payments.initialize({
  publishableKey: 'PUBLISHABLE_KEY', // Your Stripe publishable key
  merchantId: 'MERCHANT_ID' // Your Apple Pay merchant ID
})
```

Note: Apple Pay can be used only for real world items (ex. appeal, car sharing, food) and not virtual goods. For more information about proper usage of Apple Pay, visit Apple's [Apple Pay guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#apple-pay) and [Acceptable Use](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/acceptable-use-guidelines-for-websites/).

## Why ExpoKit on iOS?

Expo previously included support for a native Payments API without ExpoKit. We learned that apple sometimes rejects apps which contain the Stripe SDK but don’t offer anything for sale. To help your App Review process go more smoothly, we’ve decided to remove the Stripe SDK and experimental Payments API from apps built with the Expo standalone builder. We’re still excited to give developers a way to let users pay for goods when they need to and we’ll announce ways to do so shortly.

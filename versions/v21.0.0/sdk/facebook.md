title: Facebook

Provides Facebook integration for Expo apps. Expo exposes a minimal native API since you can access Facebook's [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) directly through HTTP (using [fetch](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html#fetch), for example).

## Registering your app with Facebook

Follow [Facebook's developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register) to register an application with Facebook's API and get an application ID. Take note of this application ID because it will be used as the `appId` option in your [`Expo.Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync`](#expofacebookloginwithreadpermissionsasync "Expo.Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync") call. Then follow these steps based on the platforms you're targetting. This will need to be done from the [Facebook developer site](https://developers.facebook.com/):

-   **The Expo client app**

    -   Add `host.exp.Exponent` as an iOS _Bundle ID_. Add `rRW++LUjmZZ+58EbN5DVhGAnkX4=` as an Android _key hash_. Your app's settings should end up including the following under "Settings > Basic":

-   **iOS standalone app**

    -   Add your app's Bundle ID as a _Bundle ID_ in app's settings page pictured above.
    -   In your [app.json](../guides/configuration.html), add a field `facebookScheme` with your Facebook login redirect URL scheme found [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios) under _4. Configure Your info.plist_. It should look like `"fb123456"`.

-   **Android standalone app**

    -   [Build your standalone app](../guides/building-standalone-apps.html#building-standalone-apps) for Android.
    -   Run `keytool -list -printcert -jarfile YOUR_APK.apk | grep SHA1 | awk '{ print $2 }' | xxd -r -p | openssl base64` (replace `YOUR_APK.apk` with the name of your APK file).
    -   Add that output as an additional key hash in your Facebook developer page pictured above.

You may have to switch the app from 'development mode' to 'public mode' on the Facebook developer page before other users can log in.

## Usage

### `Expo.Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync(appId, options)`

Prompts the user to log into Facebook and grants your app permission
to access their Facebook data.

#### param string appId

Your Facebook application ID. [Facebook's developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register) describes how to get one.

#### param object options

A map of options:

-   **permissions (_array_)** -- An array specifying the permissions to ask for from Facebook for this login. The permissions are strings as specified in the [Facebook API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions). The default permissions are `['public_profile', 'email', 'user_friends']`.
-   **behavior (_string_)** -- The type of login prompt to show. Currently this is only supported on iOS, and must be one of the following values:
    -   `'web'` (default) -- Attempts to log in through a modal `UIWebView` pop up.
    -   `'native'` -- Attempts to log in through the native Facebook app. This is only supported for standalone apps.
    -   `'browser'` -- Attempts to log in through Safari or `SFSafariViewController`. This is only supported for standalone apps.
    -   `'system'` -- Attempts to log in through the Facebook account currently signed in through the device Settings. This is only supported for standalone apps.

#### Returns

If the user or Facebook cancelled the login, returns `{ type: 'cancel' }`.

Otherwise, returns `{ type: 'success', token, expires }`. `token` is a string giving the access token to use with Facebook HTTP API requests. `expires` is the time at which this token will expire, as seconds since epoch. You can save the access token using, say, `AsyncStorage`, and use it till the expiration time.

#### Example

```javascript
async function logIn() {
  const { type, token } = await Expo.Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync('<APP_ID>', {
      permissions: ['public_profile'],
    });
  if (type === 'success') {
    // Get the user's name using Facebook's Graph API
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=${token}`);
    Alert.alert(
      'Logged in!',
      `Hi ${(await response.json()).name}!`,
    );
  }
}
```

Given a valid Facebook application ID in place of `<APP_ID>`, the code above will prompt the user to log into Facebook then display the user's name. This uses React Native's [fetch](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html#fetch) to query Facebook's [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api).

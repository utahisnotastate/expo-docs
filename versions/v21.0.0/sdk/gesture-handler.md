title: GestureHandler
---

An API for handling complex gestures. From the project's README:

> This library provides an API that exposes mobile platform specific native capabilities of touch & gesture handling and recognition. It allows for defining complex gesture handling and recognition logic that runs 100% in native thread and is therefore deterministic.

This API is available under the `DangerZone` namespace for the time being, as it is based on the quickly-improving [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler). We recommend seeing the README on the project's GitHub repository for documentation and usage examples. No native setup is required for using this API within Expo or ExpoKit.

title: ART
---

React Native comes with a built in library for simple vector drawing called ART. It is barely documented and instead you likely want to use [Svg](svg.html) which is more feature complete and better documented and more standard implementation of vector graphics.

But sometimes you'll find some code that uses ART such as [react-native-progress](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-progress) and you'll want to be able to run it on Expo, and, since ART is built in to React Native, you can.

**Again, you almost definitely want to use [Svg](svg.html) instead of this unless you are really sure you want to use ART for some reason.**
